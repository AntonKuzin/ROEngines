	description = Kerolox gas-generator engine that served as booster for Atlas (as -89, MA-x sysem) and main engine for Thor/Thor-Delta/Delta and Jupiter/Juno II rockets (as -79, MB-x system). Late model LR89s were upgraded with RS-27 components for higher efficiency, whereas the RS-27 itself was used on Delta by that point. LR89 configs are comparable to similar-era -79 configs, since they were the same engine underneath.
